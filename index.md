## Biography

I am an MSc student in Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases (Quantitative Specialization) at Yale University, with a background in Statistics and Quantitative Biology. My research interests focus on applying statistical modeling to understand how environmental factors influence infectious disease transmission. I have experience in Gaussian Processes and Machine Learning, with an emphasis on probabilistic modeling and data-driven prediction. My ultimate goal is to integrate epidemiological modeling, environmental data, and advanced statistics to generate actionable insights for disease prevention and risk mitigation.
