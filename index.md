## Biography

I am an incoming M.S. student in Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases (Quantitative Specialization) at Yale University, with a B.Sc. in Statistics and Quantitative Biology from the University of Toronto. My research interest is Environmental Epidemiology (especially in infectious disease). During my undergraduate studies, I have focused on theoretical foundations and applications of Gaussian Processes and Machine Learning, with an emphasis on probabilistic modeling and data-driven prediction. I have an ultimate goal of providing actionable insights for disease prevention and risk mitigation by integrating epidemiological modeling, environmental data analysis, and advanced statistics.
